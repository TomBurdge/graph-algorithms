This is a repository which works through the FreeCodeCamp 'Graph Algorithms for Technical Interviews' exercises and notes.<br>
You can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVWeAqZ0WU

There are notes on each presentation in the video and the answers to the exercsises are written at the bottom of each notebook in python (these were hitherto only available in JavaScript).

For each sub-section, or exercise, of the video I have created an accompanying branch.<br>
Each branch contains only a Jupyter Notebook, which works through that exercise. The exception is 6-shortest-path, which imports a function which is reused from a previous exercise.<br>
The main branch includes a very quick introduction to graphs.
